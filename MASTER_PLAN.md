# VGC Dashboard Master Plan

This is the living build plan for the Pokemon VGC dashboard. It should be updated whenever scope changes, a feature moves forward, or priorities shift.

## Product Goal

Build a Dockerized web app for Pokemon VGC that lets a user:

- save and manage multiple teams
- import teams from Pokemon Showdown
- analyze team weaknesses and role gaps
- compare saved teams against current meta snapshots
- generate matchup plans for common teams and archetypes
- later run automated battle simulations in the background

## Current Stack

- Frontend: Next.js App Router + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Runtime: Docker Compose

## Current Status

### Completed

- Git repository initialized
- Dockerized full-stack scaffold created
- Stitch-inspired routed UI shell created
- Real app routes added for dashboard, teams, analysis, meta, and testing
- Dashboard wired to API-backed data
- Showdown import parser endpoint implemented
- Showdown import UI implemented
- PostgreSQL team storage added
- Seed teams loaded into database at startup
- Team list and team detail pages wired to persisted data
- Team CRUD for metadata added
  - create blank team
  - edit team metadata
  - delete team
- Showdown import can now save directly into persisted teams
- Shared master plan document added and designated as a tracked markdown file
- Chip-style editing added for team member types and move lists
- Builder validation added for incomplete slots, duplicate species, and move/type limits
- First deterministic team analysis endpoint added for saved teams
- Team detail pages now surface structural analysis results from the API
- Dedicated Analysis page now loads and compares a selected saved team using the same analysis engine
- Meta snapshots now persist in PostgreSQL and the Meta page reads the active stored snapshot
- First-pass compare-vs-meta summaries now render for a selected saved team against active snapshot teams
- Weakness chart and richer matchup-plan fields are now live in the core team and meta workflows
- Meta snapshots can now be imported and activated from the Meta workspace
- Tournament-result snapshot automation is now live through Victory Road URL imports
- Common archetype plans and a Top 5 Teams page are now live from the active snapshot

### In Progress

- Builder UX polish is underway so editing feels closer to a real drafting workflow
- Expanding the deterministic analysis engine beyond the first structural pass
- Snapshot-management UX can still be polished, but the core import/activate flow is now functional
- Tournament-result ingestion is now the primary automation path; Showdown usage can remain a secondary future signal
- A dedicated Showdown engine service now validates and normalizes teams for builder checks and simulation preflight
- Most remaining work is polish, deeper heuristics, and simulation accuracy rather than missing core workflow pages

## Build Phases

## Phase 1: Foundation

Goal: establish a usable product shell with real routing and persistence.

Status: complete for the initial scaffold milestone

Included:

- Dockerized frontend, backend, and database
- Routed dashboard UI
- Showdown import parser
- Team persistence
- Team CRUD for metadata
- Shared master planning document

## Phase 2: Team Builder

Goal: make saved teams truly editable.

Status: next priority

Tasks:

- add/edit/remove team members
- create six-slot team builder layout
- edit item, ability, role, tera type, and move list per member
- polish validation and editing feedback in the builder
- improve form and species/form handling
- support empty slots and draft states
- allow imported teams to be refined after save

Progress:

- metadata CRUD is complete
- six-slot editing is live
- chip-style move/type editing is live
- dynamic sprite previews are live
- first-pass validation is live

## Phase 3: Analysis Engine

Goal: provide deterministic recommendations and weakness reports.

Status: complete for the MVP product scope

Tasks:

- type overlap and weakness aggregation
- speed control coverage
- role coverage checks
- offensive and defensive profile notes
- pivot/redirection/disruption support checks
- recommendation output for common structural issues

Progress:

- saved teams now have a deterministic analysis endpoint
- team detail pages now render structural readouts
- the dedicated Analysis page now lets the user choose a saved team and inspect the live structural readout
- current analysis includes type stacking, a full weakness chart, defensive buckets, speed-control checks, utility checks, and practical recommendations

## Phase 4: Meta Comparison

Goal: compare saved teams against dated format snapshots.

Status: complete

Tasks:
- create format and meta snapshot tables
- store dated top-team snapshots
- surface common threats and archetypes
- compare a selected team to snapshot teams
- highlight pressure points and exposed slots

Progress:

- meta snapshots are now stored in PostgreSQL
- the dashboard now pulls threat and meta data from the active stored snapshot
- the Meta page now loads the active snapshot through dedicated API routes
- saved team flows can now deep-link into the Meta workspace for comparison context
- selected teams now receive first-pass matchup summaries against the active snapshot teams
- matchup summaries now include preserve targets, win conditions, tera notes, and danger checklists
- snapshots can now be imported and activated without manual database edits
- Victory Road event pages can now be converted directly into stored snapshots

## Phase 5: Matchup Planning

Goal: generate practical game plans using the saved team and meta data.

Status: complete

Tasks:

- lead suggestions
- Add a weakness chart widget
- Automate the loading of meta and top team snapshots from the web
- preserve targets and win-condition notes
- danger checklist
- matchup summaries against common archetypes
- A page on the top 5 teams
- matchup summaries against top stored teams

Progress:

- matchup summaries now include lead suggestions, preserve targets, win conditions, tera notes, and danger checklists
- the Meta page now renders common archetype plans for the selected team
- the app now has a dedicated Top 5 Teams page driven by the active snapshot
- matchup planning is available both at the individual top-team level and the repeated-archetype level

## Phase 6: Simulation

Goal: add the deferred battle simulator without forcing a rewrite.

Status: complete for the requested scope

Tasks:

- worker service in Docker
- queued simulation jobs
- repeated matchup runs
- stored win/loss summaries
- recurring weakness reporting

Progress:

- background simulation jobs are now persisted in PostgreSQL
- a dedicated worker service is now part of Docker Compose
- the Testing page now launches 10-game queued runs against the active top meta team or a pasted Showdown opponent
- completed runs now store win/loss results, repeated issues, top threats, and follow-up recommendations
- a dedicated Showdown engine service now validates and packs teams before simulation work uses them
- pasted input-team simulations now run through direct Showdown battle-stream execution with random legal-choice bots
- seeded and imported top-meta simulations now also run through direct Showdown battle-stream execution whenever the stored snapshot includes full sets
- Victory Road imports now pull full OTS sets from both `vrpastes.com` and `pokepast.es` when available

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Keep polishing builder ergonomics around species/forms and slot editing flow.
2. Expand the analysis engine with richer role and matchup heuristics.
3. Polish snapshot-management UX and extend web-ingestion helpers beyond Victory Road.
4. Add secondary Showdown-based trend ingestion only if it improves, not replaces, tournament snapshots.
5. Upgrade the battle bots from random legal-choice play to stronger scripted or search-based agents if simulation fidelity becomes the next priority.

## Last Updated Snapshot

- Current active milestone: Post-MVP Polish
- Last completed milestone: Direct Showdown simulation for both pasted opponents and full-set top-meta snapshots
- Current progress: the full requested app loop is now live, including saved teams, Showdown import, analysis, stored snapshots, matchup planning, Showdown-backed validation, tournament-result ingestion, and direct Showdown execution for both pasted and top-meta simulation runs when full sets are available
- Current next recommendation: keep tournament results as the primary meta-snapshot source and treat further work as quality improvements rather than missing core scope

## Notes

- Meta data should be snapshot-based and dated, not hardcoded as universally current.
- When move recommendations and suggested sets are added, Smogon should be used as the primary moveset reference source.
- Tournament results are a better primary source for automated meta snapshots than Showdown ladder data; Showdown should be treated as supplemental usage context.
- The current simulation lane is an MVP: queued, stored, and useful for workflow testing, but not yet battle-accurate in the way a full Pokemon Showdown engine integration would be.
- Showdown is now part of the runtime as a dedicated validation and packing service, which reduces risk when swapping the simulator core later.
- Direct Showdown battle execution is now in use for pasted input-team runs and for top-meta snapshot teams whenever a full stored set is available.
- Victory Road tournament imports now support both `vrpastes.com` and `pokepast.es` open-team-sheet links.
- This document is intended to stay concise and operational rather than become a design essay.
